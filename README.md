# Isabella-Alexis Grant McCollum Portfolio Website

This is a React-based portfolio website for Isabella-Alexis Grant McCollum, showcasing her skills, projects, and contact information.

## Getting Started

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). It is recommended to use the LTS (Long Term Support) version.

### Installation

1.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd isabella-portfolio
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the local development server and view the website in your browser:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will typically open the website at `http://localhost:5173` in your default browser. Any changes you make to the source code will automatically refresh in the browser.

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of the website (optimized for deployment):

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will generate a `dist` folder containing the optimized static files.
